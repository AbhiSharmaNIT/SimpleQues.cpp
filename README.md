When someone refers to a "simple coding question from LeetCode in C++," they are typically talking about a programming problem hosted on the LeetCode platform that is considered to be of low or easy difficulty level. LeetCode is a website that offers a variety of coding challenges to help individuals practice and improve their programming skills.

A simple coding question on LeetCode often involves fundamental concepts and basic problem-solving skills. Some examples of simple coding questions could include:

1. Finding the sum of two numbers.
2. Reversing a string.
3. Counting the number of occurrences of a character in a string.

These problems are designed to test your understanding of basic programming constructs and data structures in the context of the C++ programming language. Solving such problems can help you build a solid foundation before moving on to more complex coding challenges.
Certainly! Here's a simple example of a C++ program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Let me break down the code for you:

- `#include <iostream>`: This line includes the input/output stream library, which is necessary for using standard input/output operations in C++.

- `int main()`: This is the main function where the execution of the program begins. The `int` before `main` indicates that the function returns an integer.

- `{}`: These curly braces denote the scope of the `main` function.

- `std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;`: This line prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console. `std::cout` is the standard output stream, and `<<` is the stream insertion operator used to output data. `std::endl` is used to insert a newline character and flush the output buffer.

- `return 0;`: Indicates that the program executed successfully and returns 0 to the operating system.

This is a classic example often used for introducing programming languages, and it serves as a simple starting point for understanding basic C++ syntax and structure.
